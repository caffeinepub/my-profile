REQ-7 (repo-local deployment guide) cannot be fully verified from the provided diff summary because the actual root-level DEPLOYMENT.md file is not included among the added files (only referenced indirectly).",

      "reason": "The diff summary does not show a root-level deployment document (e.g., DEPLOYMENT.md) being added/modified, so the required guide content (prereqs, build steps, deploy steps, URL retrieval) cannot be confirmed from the evidence provided. While frontend-file-summaries.txt mentions DEPLOYMENT.md, the file itself is not present in the added/modified file list or shown.",
